# E-Commerce-RFM-Approach
## Project : E-Commerce-RFM-Approach
## Overview

### This project is an implementation of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach for analyzing customer value in an e-commerce setting. RFM analysis is a technique used by businesses to segment their customer base based on their purchasing behavior. The acronym stands for:

    Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
    Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases
    Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases

By analyzing these three metrics, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior and tailor their marketing and retention strategies accordingly.
Features

    RFM Calculation: Calculates RFM scores for each customer based on their transaction history.
    Customer Segmentation: Segments customers into different groups based on their RFM scores.
    Visualization: Provides visualizations such as RFM scatter plots and segmented customer distribution.
