## Project : E-Commerce-RFM-Approach
## Overview

### This project is an implementation of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach for analyzing customer value in an e-commerce setting. RFM analysis is a technique used by businesses to segment their customer base based on their purchasing behavior. The acronym stands for:
